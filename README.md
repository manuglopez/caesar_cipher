# Caesar Cipher 
Caesar Cipher made for Odin Project.

In this project Is has been used some available methods from ruby classes as [Array#rotate](https://ruby-doc.org/core-2.7.0/Array.html#method-i-rotate) wich pertmit us to rotate the entire alphabet to the desired position.

After that, I have used a Hash to acomodate de key with the corresponding letter from the alpabet to the shifted position.

After that all is simple and we only map every letter in the message to de shifted value wich return an array that can be join to output the encripted message.

You can fork this propject in [repl.it](https://replit.com/@manuglopez/Caesar-Cipher#main.rb)
